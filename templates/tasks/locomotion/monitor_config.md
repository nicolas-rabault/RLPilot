## Task Type
locomotion

## Quality Metrics — Tier 1 (Derived from WandB)

Computed every monitor tick from raw WandB metrics. No training code changes needed.

| Metric | Source | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| symmetry_ratio | Torque/* L vs R joints | 0.3 | 1.0 = perfectly symmetric, 0.0 = fully asymmetric |
| action_smoothness | Episode_Reward/action_rate_l2 | 0.2 | Normalized smoothness score from action rate penalty |
| survival_ratio | Episode_Termination/* | 0.2 | Fraction of episodes ending in timeout (survived) vs fell |
| reward_balance | Episode_Reward/* ratios | 0.3 | Balance between locomotion and regularization rewards |

Composite quality_score = weighted sum of above, clamped to [0, 1].

## Quality Metrics — Tier 2 (Eval-Time)

Computed during policy evaluation from full simulation trajectories.

| Metric | Description | Good Range |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| joint_jerk | Mean jerk (d³pos/dt³) across joints | < 50.0 |
| step_periodicity | FFT dominant frequency strength on foot contacts | > 0.5 |
| stance_swing_ratio | Per-foot ground/air time ratio | 0.5 — 0.7 stance |
| phase_offset | L/R foot contact timing offset | 0.4 — 0.6 |
| grf_profile_score | Vertical force pattern naturalness | > 0.5 |

Composite detailed_quality_score = mean of normalized sub-scores, clamped to [0, 1].

## Actuator Mapping

Left/right pairs for symmetry computation (customize per robot):
- left: [<left_joint_1>, <left_joint_2>, ...]
- right: [<right_joint_1>, <right_joint_2>, ...]

Locomotion reward prefixes (for reward_balance):
- locomotion: [track_linear_velocity, track_angular_velocity]
- regularization: [upright, pose, action_rate_l2, foot_slip]

## Decision Rules

- quality_score_bad_threshold: 0.4
- quality_declining_monitors: 2
- quality_finish_minimum: 0.7
- reward_vs_quality_divergence: true

When reward_vs_quality_divergence is true:
- If reward is improving (> 5% gain) but quality_score is declining (> 5% drop) for quality_declining_monitors consecutive monitors → BAD

## Human Feedback Tags

- asymmetric_gait: Left/right legs behave differently
- jerky_motion: Abrupt, non-smooth movements
- shuffling: Feet barely leave the ground
- stumbling: Frequent near-falls or recovery motions
- reward_hacking: Achieves reward through unintended behavior
- too_conservative: Overly cautious, barely moving
- unstable_at_speed: Falls or wobbles at higher commanded velocities
- unnatural_posture: Body orientation or lean looks wrong
